hiwayDB
=======

The goal of this Project is to extend a scientific workflow management system running
on top of Hadoop with a database for storing statistical information persistently. Such statistics
are useful for many use cases, for instance for providing a scheduler (e.g.<a href="https://github.com/marcbux/Hi-WAY"> Hi-Way</a>) with estimates on the runtime
of future tasks or for further applications like progress and time-remaining estimation.
